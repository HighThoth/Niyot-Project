Armitage is a scriptable red team collaboration tool for Metasploit that visualizes targets, recommends exploits, and exposes the advanced post-exploitation features in the framework

In case it isnt preinstalled, run the following commands on your terminal -

- apt-get update
- apt-get install armitage

The tool is mostly self-explanatory due to its GUI.
simulating an attack on a Windows XP system using Armitage on Kali Linux.

Launch Armitage by typing:
- service postgresql start armitage

First, we need to ‘discover’ this host.
- Hosts -> nmap scan
OR
we could manually ‘add host’ by providing its IP.

Now I can see this windows XP host in Armitage workspace. From here, I could manually search for vulnerabilities on the Windows XP and then try to exploit them, but I chose the easy way on Armitage, which is ‘Hail Mary
- Attacks -> Hail Mary

Hail Mary tried some common exploits relating to available services on victim machine and gave me the ‘red’ around that host, which means the host is compromised

We gain access to cmd.exe ‘command prompt’ in windows.
